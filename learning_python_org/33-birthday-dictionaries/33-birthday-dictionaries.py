# This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2,
# Part 3, and Part 4.
# For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information
# based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run
# your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them.
