# 
# This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1,
# Part 2, and Part 4.
# In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. In this exercise,
# load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have
# a birthday in each month.
#
# Your program should output something like:
#
# {
# 	"May": 3,
# 	"November": 2,
# 	"December": 1
# }
