# 
# This exercise is Part 4 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1,
# Part 2, and Part 3.
# In the previous exercise we counted how many birthdays there are in each month in our dictionary of birthdays.
#
# In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a histogram of which months the scientists have birthdays in!
# Because it would take a long time for you to input the months of various scientists, you can use my scientist
# birthday JSON file. Just parse out the months (if you donâ€™t know how, I suggest looking at the previous exercise or
# its solution) and draw your histogram.
